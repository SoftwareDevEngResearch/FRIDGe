# FRIDGe
Fast Reactor Input Deck Generator is a general purpose fast reactor MCNP input deck creator.
Currently FRIDGe has the ability to create two different types of assemblies; fuel and blank.
These assemblies can the be arranged to create a full reactor core model.
The input file gives the user the ability to set the temperature, cross-section set, and MCNP variables for a given problem.
